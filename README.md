# Confetti
While decorating a cake with Dr. Oetker Decor Confetti (https://www.oetker.de/unsere-produkte/dekorieren/dekorieren-in-bunt/dekor-konfetti) I noticed that the red confetti seemed to be more frequent than the other colors. And I wanted to know for sure: Therefore, I (literally) drew a sample of decor confetti, placed it on a sheet of white paper and took a photograph.

In this notebook [Confetti.ipynb](Confetti.ipynb) I describe the process of identifying the confetti pieces, extracting color information and finally evaluating the distribution of colors.

*Spoiler*: The red confetti is indeed more frequent.
